## 🌟 What is This Game?

The Vocabulary Matching Game is a **cutting-edge educational tool** that revolutionizes how students learn and retain vocabulary. Using modern web technologies, beautiful glassmorphism design, and **AI-powered adaptive learning**, it creates an engaging environment where learners match concepts with their definitions through intuitive interactions.

### 🧠 **Adaptive Learning Engine**
Our game features a sophisticated **spaced repetition system** that learns from your performance:
- **FSRS Algorithm**: Uses the latest Free Spaced Repetition Scheduler for optimal timing
- **Individual Word Tracking**: Each word has its own difficulty, stability, and retrievability metrics
- **Smart Word Selection**: AI chooses which words to show based on forgetting curves and performance
- **Personalized Difficulty**: Adapts to your learning speed and ability level

### 🎮 Core Game Concept

**The Challenge**: Players are presented with two panels - one containing **concepts** (terms, words, or topics) and another containing **definitions** (explanations or descriptions). The goal is to correctly match each concept with its corresponding definition by clicking on pairs.

**The Magic**:
- ✨ **Immediate Feedback**: Correct matches disappear with celebratory animations and sound effects
- 🎵 **Audio-Visual Rewards**: Success triggers musical chords and visual celebrations
- 📱 **Haptic Response**: Wrong matches provide gentle vibration feedback on mobile devices
- 🧠 **Adaptive Scoring**: Points decrease with more attempts, encouraging accuracy
- 💡 **Smart Hints**: Get visual cues when you're stuck

### 🎯 Educational Philosophy

This game is built on proven learning principles:

1. **Active Learning**: Hands-on interaction rather than passive reading
2. **Immediate Feedback**: Instant confirmation builds confidence and corrects mistakes
3. **Gamification**: Points, progress tracking, and achievements motivate continued learning
4. **Spaced Repetition**: Multiple rounds reinforce memory retention
5. **Adaptive Difficulty**: Self-paced learning accommodates different skill levels

## 🧠 Adaptive Learning System

### 📊 **Data Logging & Analytics**
The adaptive learning engine tracks comprehensive data at three levels:

#### **User Level**
- **Ability Estimation** (θ parameter from Item Response Theory)
- **Learning Patterns**: Session frequency, study habits, fatigue monitoring
- **Progress Tracking**: Total words mastered, daily streaks, session analytics

#### **Word Level** (Most Important)
- **FSRS Parameters**: Stability (S) and Retrievability (R) for optimal spacing
- **Performance History**: Total reviews, accuracy, response times, error patterns
- **Difficulty Modeling**: Dynamic difficulty based on individual performance
- **Context Tracking**: Subject tags, confusion pairs, mnemonic usage

#### **Session Level**
- **Cognitive Load Profiling**: Difficulty progression during sessions
- **Fatigue Analysis**: Performance changes over time
- **Adaptive Adjustments**: Real-time difficulty and content adaptation

### 🎯 **Smart Word Selection Algorithm**

The AI uses multiple factors to choose which words to present:

1. **Spaced Repetition**: Words due for review based on forgetting curves
2. **Difficulty Matching**: Align word difficulty with user ability (Flow Theory)
3. **Error Recovery**: Prioritize previously missed words
4. **Exploration vs Exploitation**: Balance known words with uncertainty exploration
5. **Learning State**: Different priorities for new, learning, and mature words

### 🔬 **Scientific Foundations**

- **FSRS Algorithm**: Latest advancement in spaced repetition research
- **Item Response Theory**: Psychometric modeling for ability estimation

## 🔧 Customization Guide

### 🎨 **Creating Custom Themes**

Modify the CSS variables in `styles.css`:

```css
:root {
  /* Primary color scheme */
  --gradient-start: #667eea;
  --gradient-middle: #764ba2;
  --gradient-end: #f093fb;

  /* Feedback colors */
  --success-color: #48bb78;
  --error-color: #e53e3e;
  --hint-color: #ffd700;

  /* Glass morphism effects */
  --glass-bg: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.12);
  --glass-border: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.15);
  --glass-blur: 20px;
}
```

### 🎮 **Adjusting Difficulty**

Modify game parameters in `game-engine.js`:

```javascript
// Easy Mode (3-5 matches per round)
this.currentRound = gameData.slice(0, Math.min(5, gameData.length));

// Normal Mode (5-8 matches per round) - Default
this.currentRound = gameData.slice(0, Math.min(8, gameData.length));

// Hard Mode (8-15 matches per round)
this.currentRound = gameData.slice(0, Math.min(15, gameData.length));

// Expert Mode (All vocabulary)
this.currentRound = [...gameData];
```

### 🔊 **Sound Customization**

Adjust audio feedback in `audio-manager.js`:

```javascript
// Change success chord progression
oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(440, currentTime);    // A4
oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(554.37, currentTime + 0.1); // C#5
oscillator.frequency.setValueAtTime(659.25, currentTime + 0.2); // E5

// Modify haptic feedback pattern
navigator.vibrate([200, 100, 200, 100, 200]); // Custom vibration pattern
```
