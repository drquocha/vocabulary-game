# 📚 Dataset Management

This folder contains CSV vocabulary datasets for the game. The system automatically discovers all CSV files in this folder.

## 🚀 How to Add New Datasets

1. **Add your CSV file** to this `data/` folder
2. **Run the update script** to refresh the dataset list:
   ```bash
   python3 update_datasets.py
   ```
3. **Refresh the game** in your browser - your new dataset will appear in the dropdown!

## 📝 CSV Format Requirements

Your CSV files should follow this format:

```csv
concept,definition
Photosynthesis,The process by which plants convert sunlight into energy
Democracy,A system of government where citizens vote for their representatives
```

**Important notes:**
- First row can be headers (concept,definition) or (term,definition) - they will be automatically skipped
- Each row should have exactly 2 columns: concept and definition
- Use quotes around text that contains commas
- UTF-8 encoding is recommended for international characters

## 🔄 Automatic Discovery

The game uses `datasets.json` as a manifest file that lists all available datasets. This file is automatically generated by the `update_datasets.py` script.

**Current datasets:**
- `pali.csv` - Pali language vocabulary
- `sample_vocabulary.csv` - Sample educational vocabulary
- `words.csv` - General vocabulary words

## 🛠️ Technical Details

- The DataManager loads the dataset list from `datasets.json`
- If the manifest is missing, it falls back to checking for common file names
- All CSV files are automatically discovered when you run the update script
- The game supports unlimited datasets - just add more CSV files!

## 💡 Tips

- Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `biology_terms.csv`, `spanish_vocabulary.csv`)
- Keep each dataset focused on a specific topic for better learning
- Test your CSV file by uploading it manually first to ensure proper formatting
- Datasets can contain any number of vocabulary pairs (minimum 4 for smallest grid)
